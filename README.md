## 🧠 The Disembodied Intelligence Problem
In 2026, building an intelligent AI agent is easy. Deploying one safely inside real-world infrastructure is not. 

Models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini are incredibly smart, but they are essentially "brains in a jar". They can reason, but they lack a governable, physical-like environment to act. Most current frameworks attempt to solve this by either restricting the agent to a headless browser sandbox, or giving it dangerous, unauditable access to the host system.

**Open Infra Agent** is the world's first open-source **Autonomous Operating Environment (AOE)**. We don't build the intelligence; we provide the **digital organism** where your AI lives, works, and acts safely.

---

## 🧬 The Anatomy of the Digital Organism
We mapped the biological necessities of a living organism into a highly performant, open-source infrastructure stack:

| Biology | Technical Implementation | Function in the Organism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🧠 The Brain** | **Any LLM / Agent** | The intelligence (Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek). You bring the mind, we do the rest. |
| **👀 The Eyes** | [BrowserOS](file:///c:/Users/Doto/Desktop/PROJETOS-2026/open-infro-agentc/iagenciad/src/mcp/compressor.ts) Integration | Visual perception. 65% compressed multimodal context, saving massive token costs. |
| **⚡ The Nervous System** | **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Connects the brain to the body. Zero glue code. 12ms execution roundtrip. |
| **✋ The Hands** | [Shell & OS Automation APIs](file:///c:/Users/Doto/Desktop/PROJETOS-2026/open-infro-agentc/iagenciad/src/nut/nut.service.ts) | Real OS-level mouse, keyboard, and terminal manipulation capabilities. |
| **🫁 The Body (Skin)** | [Docker Containers](file:///c:/Users/Doto/Desktop/PROJETOS-2026/open-infro-agentc/iagenciad/Dockerfile) | A fully isolated, disposable Ubuntu 22.04 workspace. Protects the host infrastructure. |
| **👁️‍🗨️ The Conscience** | [Audit Logs & Video Capture](file:///c:/Users/Doto/Desktop/PROJETOS-2026/open-infro-agentc/iagenciad/src/input-tracking/input-tracking.service.ts) | Every click, command, and keystroke is structurally logged. No black boxes. |
| **🧑‍⚕️ The Supervision** | **Human-in-the-loop (noVNC)** | Watch the agent live in your browser. Pause, take over the mouse, and hand it back. |

## 🚀 The Cockpit vs. The Engine
A common question we get is: *"How does this compare to workspaces like Odysseus or Open WebUI?"*

They are not competitors; they are complementary. Projects like Odysseus act as the **Cockpit** (the chat interface and multi-user dashboard). **Open Infra Agent is the Engine.** 

$$\text{User} \longrightarrow \text{Odysseus (Cockpit)} \longrightarrow \text{Agent Framework} \longrightarrow \text{Open Infra Agent (The Organismo / Body)}$$

We provide the heavy infrastructure layer where the actual execution happens behind the scenes.

---

## 🛡️ Current Limitations & Roadmap (v0.1)
We believe in absolute technical honesty. Open Infra Agent is designed for defense-in-depth, but we are currently at **v0.1**:

* **✅ Currently Active:** Container namespace isolation, visual sandboxing, and `execFile` injection-safe input routing.
* **🚧 Coming in v0.2:** Strict Seccomp profiles (system call whitelisting), cgroups v2 limits (to prevent CPU/RAM resource exhaustion by agents), and append-only tamper-evident audit logs.

---

## ⚡ Performance Profile
Tested on our standard runtime stack:
* **Start Latency:** `~3.5 seconds` — from `docker compose up` to a fully responsive, visual MCP-accessible environment.
* **Execution Roundtrip:** `~12ms` — from MCP tool call to OS-level input driver.
* **Idle RAM Footprint:** `~240MB` — entire X11 + XFCE4 + noVNC + NestJS stack.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

**1. Clone and Boot:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotojr123/open-infro-agentc.git
cd open-infro-agentc
docker compose up --build -d
```

**2. Watch the Organism Live:**  
Open your browser and navigate to:  
👉 **`http://localhost:9990/vnc`**

**3. Connect Your Agent (The Brain):**  
Point any MCP-compatible agent (Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI) to the nervous system:  
👉 **`http://localhost:9990/mcp`**

---

## 📡 API & MCP Tools Available Out-of-the-Box
Once connected, your agent instantly gains access to:
* 🖱️ `computer_move_mouse`, `computer_click_mouse`, `computer_drag_mouse`, `computer_scroll`
* ⌨️ `computer_type_text`, `computer_type_keys`
* 📸 `computer_screenshot` (Optimized for LLM vision)
* 📁 `computer_read_file`, `computer_write_file`
* 🖥️ `computer_application` (Launch VS Code, Terminal, Firefox natively)

## 🇧🇷 Resumo em Português

**Open Infra Agent** é o organismo digital para agentes autônomos.

Hoje, modelos como ChatGPT e Claude são apenas "cérebros presos em uma jarra". Eles têm a inteligência, mas não têm um corpo para agir com segurança no mundo real. Nós resolvemos isso fornecendo um Ambiente Operacional Autônomo (AOE) completo.

Nós entregamos o corpo (contêineres Ubuntu isolados), o sistema nervoso (MCP nativo), as mãos (APIs de automação de mouse/teclado) e os olhos (BrowserOS). Tudo isso com Supervisão Humana em Tempo Real (Human-in-the-Loop) via navegador, permitindo que equipes de DevOps e Segurança auditem e assumam o controle do agente a qualquer momento.
